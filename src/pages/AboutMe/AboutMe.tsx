        <h3>üéØ About me</h3>
        <span>
          üíª I'm a professional, competent and passionate Software Engineer. I'm
          experienced in web development, frontend design and UI, which I find
          very rewarding. I also have knowledge in backend, ReST APIs and
          database design, which allows me to easily adapt to most job
          positions, being able to work as a full-stack developer.
          <br />‚ö° I tend to be very (VERY) fast developing features in
          technologies I'm confortable with. But learning a new stack is not a
          problem for me, but rather another strength. My eager to learn has
          pushed me from frontend into architecture design and cloud services.
          <div></div>
          üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ I enjoy teamworking and pursuing sinergies to get the best of me
          and the team. I'm always willing to (constructively) criticize design,
          processes and approaches; and also to be criticized in order to learn
          and improve my outcomes. I've developed most of my career in english
          and, thus, I can effectively communicate with my coworkers whether
          they speak english or spanish.
          <div></div>
          üõ† Regarding coding and development knowledge, I'm devoted to clean
          code practices, design patterns, refactoring principles and continuous
          integration/deployment techniques. I may write good or bad code but
          I'm always aware of its quality.
          <div></div>
          üìà I'm also a solid defender of agile development and certified Scrum
          Master, and I've some knowledge in agile project management.
