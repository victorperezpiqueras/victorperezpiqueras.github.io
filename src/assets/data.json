  "aboutMe": {
    "aboutText": "💻 I'm a professional, competent and passionate Software Engineer. I'm experienced in web development, frontend design and UI, which I find very rewarding. I also have knowledge in backend, ReST APIs and database design, which allows me to easily adapt to most job positions, being able to work as a full-stack developer.\n⚡ I tend to be very (VERY) fast developing features in technologies I'm confortable with. But learning a new stack is not a problem for me, but rather another strength. My eager to learn has pushed me from frontend into architecture design and cloud services.\n👨🏻‍🏫 I enjoy teamworking and pursuing sinergies to get the best of me and the team. I'm always willing to (constructively) criticize design, processes and approaches; and also to be criticized in order to learn and improve my outcomes. I've developed most of my career in english and, thus, I can effectively communicate with my coworkers whether they speak english or spanish.\n🛠 Regarding coding and development knowledge, I'm devoted to clean code practices, design patterns, refactoring principles and continuous integration/deployment techniques. I may write good or bad code but I'm always aware of its quality.\n📈 I'm also a solid defender of agile development and certified Scrum Master, and I've some knowledge in agile project management.",
